/**
 * LiveScoreboard Component Tests
 *
 * Note: Full Jest tests are currently blocked by ES module compatibility issues
 * with Supabase dependencies. This file serves as a placeholder for the test structure.
 *
 * Test Coverage Plan:
 * - Rendering states (loading, error, success)
 * - Real-time updates functionality
 * - Statistics calculations
 * - Compact vs full view modes
 * - Connection status indicators
 * - Streak celebrations
 * - Accessibility features
 *
 * To run these tests, the Jest configuration needs to be updated to handle
 * ES modules from @supabase/supabase-js and related dependencies.
